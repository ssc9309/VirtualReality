1. Uninstall, download and install a fresh copy of VLC from videolan.org
2. Run the .bat script, VLC opens up on desktop automatically
3. View>add interface>web
4. Tools>preference>show settings>all>interface>click on web>in the dialog box, type --http-password=vlcdirect
5. Save and restart VLC

On remote app, auto discovery works just fine. Hope this helps.

This is not quite what I want.
This streams RECORDED videos. Not live feed.
Tried the live feed on simply local VLC on pc, Media > Open Capture Devices > Video device name "USB webcam"
    There was a lot of lag.
